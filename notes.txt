BURNOUT DETECTION SYSTEM - Learning Notes
==========================================

Project Started: December 29, 2025

------------------------------------------
SETUP
------------------------------------------
- Created virtual environment with: python -m venv venv
- Virtual environment = isolated space for this project's packages
- Activated with: venv\Scripts\activate
- (venv) at the start of terminal means it's active

------------------------------------------
NLP BASICS
------------------------------------------
- NLP = Natural Language Processing
- Teaches computers to understand human text
- We use a PRE-TRAINED model (someone else already trained it)
- Model reads text → outputs emotions with percentages

------------------------------------------
FIRST NLP TEST - SUCCESS
------------------------------------------
- I made a test_nlp file to see how the pretrained model works
- "exhausted from work..." → sadness: 87%
- "got promoted, so happy..." → joy: 97%
- The model correctly detects emotions from text!
- This is the "brain" of our burnout system

------------------------------------------
ANALYSIS ENGINE - PART 1
------------------------------------------
- class = blueprint for creating objects
- __init__ = runs automatically when object is created
- self = refers to the object (like "this" in C#)
- self.classifier = stores the model so we can use it later
- pipeline() = HuggingFace shortcut to load AI models

------------------------------------------
STRESS & CLAMPING IN ANALYZE FUNCTION
------------------------------------------
Stress contribution:
- (stress_level - 5) * 5
- Level 5 = neutral (0 points)
- Below 5 = negative (reduces burnout)
- Above 5 = positive (increases burnout)

Clamping:
- max(0, min(100, score))
- Ensures score stays between 0-100
- min() caps the top at 100
- max() caps the bottom at 0
